# lottie
A web application using Next.JS and Apollo Server.

This project uses a [Github Project Board](https://github.com/bgfernandes/lottie/projects/1) for organization.

## Development setup
1. Install Node (https://nodejs.org/). For this project, I'm using version 14.17.4, as denoted in the *.tool-versions* file. I recommend using a node versioning manager, like ASDF (https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) with the NodeJS plugin (https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs). NVM is also very popular (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
